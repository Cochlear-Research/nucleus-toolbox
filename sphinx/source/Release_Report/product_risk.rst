Product Risk Summary
################################################################################

|SW| does not have regulatory approval.
By itself, |SW| does not interact with a cochlear implant system,
and no hazards can arise.

|SW| can also be used with |NIC| (NIC).
Pulse sequences that are created with |SW| can be delivered
to a cochlear implant recipient by NIC.
In such cases, all the conditions that apply to NIC
also apply to |SW|.
When a researcher uses |SW| with NIC,
the researcher becomes the manufacturer of a software medical device
and is legally responsible for its verification and safety.
The researcher must obtain Human Research Ethics approval for use
of |SW| and NIC with recipients.
